Project Components
1. Data Collection
Tools: Python, APIs, Web Scraping
Description: The data is collected from various sources, including APIs and web scraping techniques. This data serves as the foundation for further analysis.
2. Data Preprocessing
Tools: Pandas, NumPy
Description: The collected data is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and other inconsistencies. This step ensures that the data is in a suitable format for analysis.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
Description: EDA is performed to understand the underlying patterns and relationships within the data. Visualizations and statistical summaries are used to gain insights and guide further analysis.
4. Modeling
Tools: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras
Description: Various machine learning models are built and trained on the preprocessed data. This includes supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to predict outcomes and find patterns.
5. Evaluation
Tools: Scikit-learn, Metrics libraries
Description: The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. This step ensures that the models are effective and reliable.
6. Deployment (Optional)
Tools: Flask, Docker, Heroku
Description: The trained models can be deployed as web applications or APIs for real-time predictions. This step involves setting up a deployment pipeline and integrating with web frameworks or cloud platforms.
